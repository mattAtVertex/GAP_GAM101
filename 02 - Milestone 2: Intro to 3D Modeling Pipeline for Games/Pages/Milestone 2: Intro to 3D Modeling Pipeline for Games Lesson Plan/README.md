# Milestone 2: Intro to 3D Modeling Pipeline for Games Lesson Plan

<h3><span>Objective</span></h3>
<p><span>In this sprint, you will be introduced to the 3D modeling pipeline used in the game industry for props. For the project, you will be working on simple models to more quickly get familiarized with the pipeline process. We will be covering the basics around the high to low poly modeling and baking process.</span></p>

<h3><span>Assignment</span></h3>
<p>You will be creating both the high poly, low poly, and UVs for a crate and barrel as was demonstrated in<span> the lessons</span>.&nbsp; The following images need to be included in your post:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 1 angle of your high poly of the crate and barrel</li>
<li>At least 1 angle of your low poly of the crate and barrel</li>
<li>Screenshot of your UV layout</li>
<li>Screenshot of your baked models (from Substance viewport is fine)</li>
</ul>
